# Notebooks

Here are all the notebooks I created to try to reproduce experiences and results of the paper.
<br/>
I worked on the section VII of the paper (censorship), and I reproduced the two histograms page 12 (figure 9). 
I manage to reproduce these (my python code is commented on the notebooks) and the only difference that I had is that for the histogram of the 4th TLS record, I don't have a peak at 88 like they did, even if I used their data.
<br/>
<br/>

- *4thpacket* -- my python code to reproduce the histogram of the 4th TLS record length
- *domain-length* --my python code to reproduce the histogram of the first-party domain length
- *comparison* --my python code to compare the two histograms and compute their entropy
<br/>
<br/>
All of my work is commented in the notebooks.
